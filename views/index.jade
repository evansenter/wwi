        p.
          At WWI we're dedicated to being an institution composed of thought leaders in academia and science,
          dedicated to finding creative solutions to the world's most pressing environmental issues.
          We want to discover new technologies that transform historical use, distribution, and regulation
          of water and its associated rights by leveraging science, policy, and finance. Our researchers will
          unveil approaches to water resource management that transform the way the nation and the world
          thinks about and uses water.
